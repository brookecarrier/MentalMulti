## App Description
Mental Multi is an iOS app built to help users level up their mental multiplication skills. It includes 4 game modes (explained below) designed to boost speed and accuracy. From simple 1x1 digit problems to challenging 3x3 digit calculations, Mental Multi welcomes all skill levels and ages. 

## Game Modes
üå∑ Zen: No clock. No points. No streak. Relax and multiply at your own pace.<br>
‚è±Ô∏è Timed: Solve each problem before time runs out! You have 3 lives to lose for being too slow, being incorrect, or skipping.<br>
‚öîÔ∏è Survival: Keep the streak! Answer as many questions in a row as you can. Be careful ‚Äî one mistake or skip, and it‚Äôs Game Over.<br>
‚ö°Ô∏è Blitz: You have 60 seconds to solve as many problems as possible. Each wrong answer or skip subtracts 3 seconds from the clock.<br>
